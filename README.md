# Links Storage - Website for hyperlinks storing

This project is created by using: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP and MySQL.


## Why is this project useful?

This project works on the principle of bookmarks in the browsers. We know that all modern web browsers include bookmark features. The biggest disadvantage of browsers' bookmarks is that if the user change the browser he will not have access to his bookmakrs. So the biggest advantage of this project is that the user can have access to the links he saved no matter where is he or which browser he uses.


## How to run it?

To use this project you should have installed a web server (such as Apache), PHP and MySQL database. 
 * Download the project and put it in the the required directory;
 * Open phpmyadmin and create a database 'links-storage' in which will be saved usernames, passwords etc.
 * In the created database 'links-storage' import the file run.sql (this file creates a table 'users' and set it to work properly).
